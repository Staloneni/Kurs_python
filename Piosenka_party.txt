Sailing in my pirate ship around the seven seas
I get a funny feeling from my head down to my knees
The feeling goes no further cos my legs are made of wood
I see a giant disco ball, I know this will be good

Out of the icy mist an island appears
It's shaped like a skull and it stinks like a beer
I drop the anchor down and take a swig of rum
It's time to have some fun

To the East (hey!)
To the West (hey!)
It is time for a quest
Get ready to drink 'til we die
To the North (hey!)
To the South (hey!)
Pour that rum in your mouth
Raise a glass to the sky
Get ready for a

P-A-R-TY!

Welcome to the island where your pirate dreams come true
Over there is Captain Yarrface drinking from a shoe
Everywhere you dig you'll find some treasure in a chest
The local tavern's full of crew who want to go on quests

The sun goes down that's when the party begins
We've run out of whisky so let's drink the gin
Fire the cannons and load up your guns
It's time to have some fun

To the East (hey!)
To the West (hey!)
It is time for a quest
Get ready to drink 'til we die
To the North (hey!)
To the South (hey!)
Pour that rum in your mouth
Raise a glass to the sky
Get ready for a
